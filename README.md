## Development

Here's how to run this locally in development mode.

- Make sure to use node 20 or a version of node newer than 22, e.g. with `nvm use 20`.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Open a terminal and start compiling the client and server in watch mode with `npm run watch`.
- In the Debug view in the sidebar, select `Launch Client` from the drop down (if it is not already) and press â–· to run the launch config (or simply F5).
- An Extension Development Host instance of VSCode will start with the language server running.
